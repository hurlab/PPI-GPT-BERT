2,IEPA.d112.s270,"Analyses of hormone regulation of expression of mRNA for the aleurone RNase revealed that, like the pattern for alpha-amylase, mRNA levels increased in the presence of gibberellic acid, and its antagonist abscisic acid prevented this effect"
2,IEPA.d112.s271,"Quantitative studies at early times demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment of aleurone layers increased mRNA levels 4-fold, whereas a combination of gibberellin plus cycloheximide treatment was required to increase alpha-amylase mRNA levels to the same extent"
2,IEPA.d156.s373,"Leptin is a satiety factor which acts within the hypothalamus to decrease the levels of several neuropeptides stimulating food intake (among them, neuropeptide Y [NPY]), while increasing those that inhibit food intake"
2,IEPA.d175.s424,"Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of leptin to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of a-MSH produced a 3.5 fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas NPY treatment suppressed ~3 fold proTRH biosynthesis"

2,IEPA.d197.s479,"On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2')"
2,IEPA.d197.s480,We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2
2,IEPA.d197.s481,A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity

2,IEPA.d195.s470,"Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake"
2,IEPA.d195.s471,"We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration"
2,IEPA.d195.s472,No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice
2,IEPA.d195.s473,The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion
2,IEPA.d195.s474,"Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51%"
2,IEPA.d195.s475,The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone
3,IEPA.d8.s14,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes"
3,IEPA.d8.s15,"All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3"
3,IEPA.d8.s16,"Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells"
3,IEPA.d8.s17,"It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas oxytocin and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating IP3 and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources"
3,IEPA.d9.s18,"Oxytocin induced a biphasic increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of porcine myometrial cells: participation of a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool, and Ca2+ channels"
3,IEPA.d9.s19,"Administration of OT (1 microM) for 15 sec increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation by 61%"
3,IEPA.d9.s20,"Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX, 1 microgram/ml) for 2 hr failed to alter the OT-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and IP3 formation"
3,IEPA.d9.s21,U-73122 (3 microM) also abolished the OT-induced IP3 formation
3,IEPA.d24.s48,"The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms"
3,IEPA.d24.s49,"Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly"
3,IEPA.d24.s50,Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point
3,IEPA.d24.s51,The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate
3,IEPA.d24.s52,Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels
3,IEPA.d24.s53,"In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels"
3,IEPA.d27.s57,"8-OH-DPAT also increased insulin and decreased CCK and somatostatin levels, effects that were blocked by pretreatment with the oxytocin antagonist"
3,IEPA.d27.s58,"Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of insulin, somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by oxytocin"
3,IEPA.d27.s59,"In previous experiments, we have shown that following i.c.v. application of oxytocin, plasma levels of insulin are increased through a cholinergic mechanism"

3,IEPA.d34.s81,"To establish the cell type expressing leptin, we also assessed the size and organization of lipid droplets, the ultrastructural features of mitochondria, and the presence or absence of uncoupling protein, a brown fat-specific marker"
3,IEPA.d34.s82,"In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were leptin-negative, both in fed and fasted conditions"
3,IEPA.d34.s83,"At the periphery of the interscapular brown adipose tissue depot, unilocular, UCP-negative adipocytes (mean diameter: 41.55 microns) with white-type mitochondria were observed, and these cells were leptin-positive"
3,IEPA.d34.s84,"In obese (db/db) animals, brown fat was composed mainly of small unilocular, UCP-positive adipocytes (mean diameter: 40.08 microns), which were also leptin-positive"
3,IEPA.d34.s85,"In summary, classical brown adipocytes differ from white adipocytes, not only by their morphology and UCP expression, but also by their apparent lack of detectable leptin expression"
3,IEPA.d66.s166,"However, the AVP-dependent stimulation required activation of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas the inhibition was PKC independent, indicating that the NGF-induced signaling pathways leading to inhibition and stimulation of HCO3- absorption are distinct"

3,IEPA.d129.s307,"Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats"
3,IEPA.d129.s308,"To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues"
3,IEPA.d129.s309,"We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system"
3,IEPA.d129.s310,"Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control"
3,IEPA.d129.s311,"However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics"
3,IEPA.d149.s362,"Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and leptin produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in neuropeptide Y expression"
3,IEPA.d150.s363,Possible central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms could mediate these responses in that leptin receptors are located on hypothalamic neurons that coexpress neuropeptide-Y (NPY) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and both peptides that have been implicated as mediators of the CNS action of leptin.
3,IEPA.d150.s364,Leptin has been demonstrated to decrease or down regulate NPY expression and increase POMC expression
3,IEPA.d153.s369,"Interestingly, both 5-HT and leptin modulate the action of NPY, which may form a part of a common output pathway for the expression of appetite"

3,IEPA.d157.s375,"It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in both secretory tissues"
3,IEPA.d157.s376,These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed

3,IEPA.d165.s399,The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats
3,IEPA.d165.s400,"At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed"

3,IEPA.d110.s266,"Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the AVP-induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms"
3,IEPA.d110.s267,"AVP- or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+"
3,IEPA.d110.s268,"These results show that AVP-induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta"

4,IEPA.d115.s282,"Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3."
4,IEPA.d115.s283,"Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion."

6,IEPA.d158.s378,Many studies have indicated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake
6,IEPA.d158.s379,"In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and leptin (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle"
6,IEPA.d158.s380,"However, NPY inhibited and leptin stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally"
6,IEPA.d158.s381,"Thus NPY stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and leptin has the opposite effects"
6,IEPA.d188.s451,"We also determined whether well known hypothalamic neuropeptide targets, e.g. neuropeptide Y (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) were regulated in a pattern consistent with their presumed roles as mediators of leptin action"
